In this css display we are going to study about:
   *Display
   *Buttons
   *Overflow

->Display:
   In display we can enhance the img using padding tag
   by giving [padding :10px 20px 30px 40px;] which denotes the clockwise value adding
   this 10 is for top layer followed by right,bottom,and left layer.

    *display: block; it is default thing in sense no change.
    *display: none; it will unapparently hide your content in the website.
    (VERY IMPORTANT:::)
    *display: inline; which is used to separate the specific text by highlighting them.
    and in inline we cannot use margin correction because of default margin size instead of that we can use inline-block in that 
    we can access both inline properties as well as block properties.
    by applying display properties it defaultly enhance the visibility and spacing.
    

->Overflow: 
    Overflow tag is mainly used for hidding the images getting exists from the border.
    By creating Overflow as auto we can see the excess content by scrolling.
    And also we can able to hide the x axis nor y axis according to our wish.


    //flexbox,positions,pseudoclasses and pseudoelements finally mediaqueries these are the core concepts.
