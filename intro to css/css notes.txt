CSS(Cascading style sheet)
Css implementation:
  In css there are three implementations:
               *inline implementation.->higher priority
	             *internal implementation.
               *external implementation.(In and Ex have same priority)
		(this is the priority path)

Linking of main file with css file:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css">(ie:"rel=stylesheet"->  [Relational styleesheet]which refers what file we are linking)
     
->we using external css for a clean website code analization by separating the code.
*nd there is no need of displaying the colors for same headings no repetation of same size heading alteration.code compatability.
->we using inline css for specific changes like color ,font for the same heading size.

   Inserting images or videos:
      we need to use div tag for altering img and videos actually. which act as like rapper or a parent element.
